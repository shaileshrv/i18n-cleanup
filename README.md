# i18n-cleanup

ðŸ§¹ A Node.js CLI tool to remove **duplicate translation keys** from localized i18n JSON files by comparing them to a base (typically `en`) translation file. This helps maintain **clean**, **minimal**, and **efficient** locale files for global applications.

---

## ðŸ”§ Why Use This?

When building multilingual apps, your localized files (`en_CA`, `en_GB`, etc.) often copy keys from the default locale (`en`). Over time, this leads to bloated, redundant translation files.

`i18n-cleanup` compares each locale file to the source, and **removes any key-value pairs that are exactly the same** â€” so your locale files only include overrides or unique content.
